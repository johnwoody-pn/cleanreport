# Data Quality Assessment and Cleaning Steps

## Quick Risks
- **High Missing Rates**: Columns like `Acreage`, `Air Conditioning`, `Year Built`, and `Basement` have extremely high missing rates (over 50%).
- **Type Mismatches**: Some columns expected to be numeric (e.g., `property-sqft`, `price`) may contain non-numeric values.
- **Categorical Overload**: Columns like `Garage`, `Exterior`, and `Features` have many unique values, which could complicate analysis.
- **Inconsistent Formats**: Columns like `postalCode` and `priceCurrency` may have inconsistent formats that need standardization.
- **Potential Redundancy**: Columns such as `Fireplace`, `Fireplaces`, and `Fireplace Y/N` may contain overlapping information.

## Cleaning Priorities
1. **Drop Columns with Excessive Missing Values**: Remove columns with over 95% missing data (e.g., `Air Conditioning`, `Year Built`, `Basement`).
2. **Handle Type Mismatches**: Convert columns like `property-sqft` and `price` to numeric types, ensuring to handle any non-numeric entries.
3. **Standardize Categorical Columns**: Normalize values in `postalCode`, `priceCurrency`, and other categorical columns to ensure consistency.
4. **Address High Missing Rates**: For columns with significant missing data but not exceeding the drop threshold, consider imputation or dropping rows with missing values.
5. **Remove Redundant Columns**: Evaluate and potentially drop overlapping columns such as `Fireplace`, `Fireplaces`, and `Fireplace Y/N`.

## Column-specific Tips
1. **Acreage**: Investigate the reason for high missing rates; consider imputation based on related features if applicable.
2. **Air Conditioning**: Given its 100% missing rate, consider dropping this column unless it can be sourced from another dataset.
3. **Year Built**: Similar to `Acreage`, check if this can be inferred from other columns or external data.
4. **Basement**: Assess if this can be categorized or if missing values can be inferred from other features.
5. **property-sqft**: Clean this column to ensure all entries are numeric; consider converting to float after cleaning.
6. **Garage**: Review the unique values and consider consolidating categories to reduce complexity.
7. **Exterior**: Similar to `Garage`, look for patterns and consider grouping similar types.
8. **Fireplace**: Evaluate the necessity of multiple fireplace-related columns and consolidate if possible.

## Modeling Readiness
- **Check for Duplicates**: Ensure there are no duplicate rows that could skew model training.
- **Feature Scaling**: Normalize or standardize numerical features, especially those with different scales (e.g., `price`, `property-sqft`).
- **Categorical Encoding**: Prepare categorical variables for modeling by applying one-hot encoding or label encoding as appropriate.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Conduct a correlation analysis to identify and remove highly correlated features that may lead to multicollinearity.

## Nice-to-have
- **Visualize Missing Data**: Use heatmaps or bar charts to visualize missing data patterns for better insights.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features based on existing ones, such as `total_bathrooms` from `Full Bathrooms` and `Half Bathrooms`.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify and handle outliers in numerical columns that could affect model performance.
- **Text Analysis**: If applicable, analyze text columns like `description` for insights using NLP techniques.
